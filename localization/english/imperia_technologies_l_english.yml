 evolutionary_biology: "Evolutionary Biology"
 evolutionary_biology_desc: "The understanding that the diversity of species and life is a documentable process. One which opens the doors to genes, natural selection, and other useful fields of research."

 scientific_method: "Scientific Method"
 scientific_method_desc: "The procces of using observation and skepticism in all methods for creating and testing hypotheses. This goes hand in hand with practical measurement and data."

 reactionism: "Reactionism"
 reacitonism_desc: "In response to the social movements that push the country leftward, new conservative movements have grown in kind to adapt to a changing world, with the hope it may return to what it once was."

 signal_flags: "Signal Flags"
 signal_flags_desc: "The usage of hundreds of types of flags to signal to other ships your intentions is as old as sailing. Most navies use them to communicate tactical changes, and battle developments in warfare during this time period."

 signal_lamps: "Signal Lamps"
 signal_lamps_desc: "Signal lamps allow for a much quicker and more efficient manner of communicating orders at sea and in pitched battle. By using shutters while manned by a seaman, they allow through morse code whole messages to be sent with a line of sight."

 radio_communication: "Radio Communication"
 radio_communication_desc: "The innovations of radio reach to all corners of technological uses. For our navy they allow instantaneous communication of information which means orders can be given instantly. The downside is anybody else can hear them if they look."

 heliographs: "Heliographs"
 heliographs_desc: "Heliographs use sun instead of artifical light to commnunicate. They are usable either manually or by clockwork and have the upside of not being easily interceptable."

 age_of_sail: "The Age Of Sail"
 age_of_sail_desc: "The Age of Sail was a historical period from the 16th to the mid-19th century when sailing ships were the primary means of transportation and warfare at sea.Naval warfare tactics relied heavily on maneuverability and skillful use of wind, with battles often fought at close range using cannons and boarding actions. "

 propellers: "Propellers"
 propellers_desc: "Propellers are a type of rotating device used in naval technology to propel ships through water. They work by creating a thrust force that propels the ship forward, similar to how a fan creates a flow of air. Compared to older methods of propulsion, such as sails and oars, propellers are much more efficient and allow for greater control and speed."

 steam_turbines: "Steam Turbines"
 steam_turbines_desc: "A steam turbine is a device that converts the thermal energy of steam into mechanical energy, which can be used to generate electricity or perform other types of work. The turbine consists of a rotor with a series of blades attached to it, which rotate as steam flows through them. The steam is produced in a boiler and then directed into the turbine where it expands and pushes against the blades, causing the rotor to spin. The spinning rotor is connected to a generator which converts the mechanical energy into electrical energy."

 oil_turbines: "Oil Turbines"
 oil_turbines_desc: "A gas turbine, also known as a combustion turbine or oil turbine, is a type of engine that converts the chemical energy of a fuel (such as oil, natural gas, or diesel) into mechanical energy by combustion. The turbine consists of a compressor, combustion chamber, and turbine section. The compressor draws in air and compresses it before directing it into the combustion chamber where fuel is added and ignited, creating a high-pressure, high-temperature gas. This gas then flows through the turbine section, where it expands and drives a rotor that is connected to a generator, producing electrical power."
 
 skirmisher_cavalry: "Skirmisher Cavalry"
 skirmisher_cavalry_desc: "With the rise of new forms of infantry and artillery warfare, Cavalry work to maintain their relevancy in an ever-evolving age."

 modern_cavalry_tactics: "Modern Cavalry Tactics"
 modern_cavalry_tactics_desc: "Modern militaries further relegate the role of cavalry in warfare, forcing them to adapt into less prominent and glorifying roles."

 flying_columns: "Flying Columns"
 flying_columns_desc: "What was once the pinnacle of military strength and power has now become a tool of cowardly tactics such as guerilla warfare. Cavalry's dying gasps continue headlong into the turn of the century."

 antiseptic_and_amputations: "Antiseptic & Amputations"
 antiseptic_and_amputations_desc: "The key components of a new age of medicine. With this, one can hope to buy themselves a few more days in the dreadful fields of battle. While life-saving on the frontlines, it also helped save the lives of many people at home once these doctors and nurses took this grim knowledge back with them."
