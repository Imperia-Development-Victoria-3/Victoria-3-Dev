 #Completion

 sick_man.4.t: "Tanzimat: Liberalism or Absolutism?"
 sick_man.4.d: "With the initial reforms of Mahmud II completed, taking important and necessary steps to reform the Empire into a new age, a heavy debate has broken out between the largest political blocs of the nation. The $ig_variant_devout$ and $ig_variant_armed_forces$ argue that a return to an absolutist form of Pan-Islamism will ensure a return to a stronger, centralized Ottoman State. They cite the renewed colonization efforts by Europeans and their continued industrialization as the greatest cause of concern for the country's survival.\nThe $ig_variant_industrialists$ and $ig_variant_intelligentsia$, in contrast, believe that the time is now for a constitution to be written and for a new era of the Empire to be ushered in. The Sultan, in conjunction with the will of his citizens, shall be the leaders of this brave new world."
 sick_man.4.f: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has completed the initial stages of the Tanzimat reforms. But now a decision must be made."
 sick_man.4.a: "Our future lies in the principles of Ottomanism and liberal ideas!"
 sick_man.4.b: "Our future shall be guided only by the Sultan and Allah!"

 sick_man.2.t: "Tanzimat: The Reorganization"
 sick_man.2.desc: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has successfully modernized and re-asserted itself on the world stage. A new era begins for the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] state.\nThe halting decline of our Empire has shown that we can no longer stand alone to break the darkness which threatens us all. We as Turks, Greeks, Syrians, Kurds, and many others cannot halt the threat of foreign aggression alone.But we can as Ottomans. We, as Muslims, Christians, and Jews, cannot make amends if we stand in opposition to each other. But our faith in this empire can be shared together. We allowed corruption to run too deep into our great Ottoman Empire. But no longer! Now, together, we are on a path to bring the nation to its greatest heights! Let the world see the Ottoman Empire not as the Sick Man of Europe, but as the Beacon of Liberty in the East!"
 sick_man.2.f: ""
 sick_man.2.a: "Our future lies in the heart of Western Republicanism!"
 sick_man.2.b: "All shall hail the Great Reformer!"
 sick_man.2.c: "Let all lost souls rest their weary hearts in our lands!"
 sick_man.2.d: "We are the trees of our forefathers! Let us look to our roots for inspiration!"

 sick_man.5.t: "Tanzimat: The Centralization"
 sick_man.5.desc: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has successfully modernized and re-asserted itself on the world stage. A new era begins for the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] state.\n\nWe are now the masters of our own fate. No longer shall the children of Islam bow to any mortal, but only to Allah. The Sultan, Caliph of Islam and Allah's will made manifest, has the promise of ushering us into a new age of prosperity and strength for the Empire. The snakes around us, who thought us a weak plaything for their games, now look upon us in awe as we do what no other country in history has done and pull back from the brink of self-destruction. The liberals, who sought to weaken our government's absolute authority, have now been stamped out. Now none shall stand in the Sultan's way!"
 sick_man.5.f: ""
 sick_man.5.d: "Let us usher in a Reactionary Renaissance across the Empire!"
 sick_man.5.a: "We must strengthen Sharia Law and unite Islam!"
 sick_man.5.b: "It is time to restore the Empire to its former glory!"
 sick_man.5.c: "Let us settle our old grievances and grant the Sultan absolute authority!"

 dead_man.2.f: "After years of internal strife and conflict between the different factions within the crumbling empire, a victor has emerged. The nation will forever be changed, and its people carry with them the hopes of a new beginning. The troubles of the former Empire are not all gone, but at least now we may return to the international stage as a recognized entity once again. Now comes the hard part, rebuilding the burnt bridges and crumbled walls of factionalism to reform into a new and united nation. What steps will we take next to be reborn anew?"

 dead_man_pulse.4.f: "Thousands of Turkish citizens have begun to proudly rally and protest across Anatolia for the acceptance of a Turkish ethno-nationalist identity, breaking down the efforts of the previous Sultans to embed a sense of 'Ottomanism' amongst the populace. This new strain of nationalism does strengthen the state's primary citizens, but the potential for things to go awry is great. Already several of the protests have turned violent in the Balkan and Arabic provinces that remain. The unity the Empire once held threatens to collapse if we push too hard."
 dead_man_pulse.4.a: "We can try to spin this into a more #red internationalist#! mindset by recognizing all ethnic identities."
 dead_man_pulse.4.b: "We must embolden the Turkish people, the backbone of our potential #gold Republic#!."
 dead_man_pulse.4.c: "Nationalism remains a plague on our society, the #green Islamic Faith#! must guide us instead."

 dead_man_pulse.5.t: "Kurds Offer Support...For A Price"
 dead_man_pulse.5.d: "The Kurdish people have offered support to the Ottoman Empire amongst the turmoil, something that the factions can exploit for their own benefit."
 dead_man_pulse.5.f: "While the Ottoman Empire has never formally recognized the Kurdish people's independence, the collapsing regime has had to reckon with the growing opportunism groups like them have made to strengthen their position in their respective regions. Groups of Kurdish soldiers seek to make their fortunes raiding the border regions between Kurds and Turks to satiate this opportunism, but some of their leaders have rallied them enough to offer instead a more...targeted approach."
 dead_man_pulse.5.a: "While they may not support radical policies, they could still be a useful tool for the #red Revolution#!."
 dead_man_pulse.5.b: "The Kurds would never directly support the nationalism of the #gold Republic#!, but if we can turn them on our enemies..."
 dead_man_pulse.5.c: "Our shared #green faith#!, in addition to some generous donations, will be more than enough to turn them on our side."

 dead_man_pulse.6.t: "Egypt Interferes with Ottoman Strife"
 dead_man_pulse.6.d: "Egypt, finding opportunity within the internal divisions of the Ottoman Empire, seek to leverage it for their own gain."
 dead_man_pulse.6.f: "The Egyptians have long sought the power of Istanbul for themselves, and now with our internal struggles have started to escalate border skirmishes with us, both on land and at sea. The radicals and nationalists within our country want to meet them head-on, but the Capitalists and $ig_variant_devout$ demands caution in order to avoid dragging the two nations into yet another conflict. Negotiations are under way, but the different factions' goals could result in further skirmishes from the deadlock."
 dead_man_pulse.6.a: "We will meet them #red head on#!, to protect the people from this foreign threat."
 dead_man_pulse.6.b: "While it will make us look weak in the short term, it will save us many headaches to #gold entreat#! with them."
 dead_man_pulse.6.c: "The #green Imams#! will meet and come to an amicable resolution for both sides."

 dead_man_pulse.7.t: "Pogroms Erupt Across Nation!"
 dead_man_pulse.7.d: "Fundamentalist and Nationalist radicals have begun to invade and lynch minorities in their city districts. The Sultan and Beyliks appear helpless to stop them."
 dead_man_pulse.7.f: "Despite the 'best' efforts of the Sultan and local governors to control the population, the rise of Turkish nationalism and radicalism has led to anti-minority riots to erupt. These riots involve large groups going into minority neighborhoods and districts within our cities and setting fire to buildings as well as lynching people at random. The situation has left many distraught, although some nationalists in power see it as a testament of their strength. There are many proposals between the factions on how to handle the situation, but it is up to the Sultan's cabinet to decide."
 dead_man_pulse.7.a: "We must suppress these bigoted actions immediately! #red Call up the Gendarmerie!#!"
 dead_man_pulse.7.b: "We will continue to endorse #gold Turkish nationalism#!, but advocate maintaining order."
 dead_man_pulse.7.c: "Through faith the #green Ulemma#! can stabilize the situation, given time."
 dead_man_pulse.7.e: "We will utilize the conviction of the nationalists for #green our own goals#!."

 dead_man_pulse.8.t: "Feminist Protests Disrupt Cities"
 dead_man_pulse.8.d: "The rise of Feminism across the globe has resulted in a massive movement for women to achieve equal rights within the Empire. Conservatives and Capitalists are equally enraged by this disruption."
 dead_man_pulse.8.f: "Daughters of soldiers, politicians, and common laborers alike have taken to the streets of every major city in the Empire to demand they be granted rights equal to men. The backlash from Conservatives, concerned about the erosion of women's place in society, and the Capitalists, concerned about the way this has interrupted the profitability of industries across the nation, has been swift and resolute. The paralyzation of our country from such a movement must be resolved immediately, or face dire consequences. \n \n 'Revolution without women is impossible.' - Nezihe Muhittin"
 dead_man_pulse.8.a: "The #red Ottoman Worker's Society#! endorses the progressive aims of the movement."
 dead_man_pulse.8.b: "The #gold Committee of Union & Progress#! will do their best to placate them with promises of reform."
 dead_man_pulse.8.c: "The #green Society of Islamic Unity#! will not tolerate such a radical thought."

 dead_man_pulse.9.t: "The Sultan Question"
 dead_man_pulse.9.d: "The inevitable question must now be answered. After the latest scandal from the Sultan unfolded causing an embarassment to our country once more, the factions must press their plan forward on how to handle the Sultan once the coup succeeds. The real difficulty has been persuading both the people and the nobility to one option."
 dead_man_pulse.9.f: "#red The Ottoman Worker's Society#! are planning a most extreme option, that the Sultan be tried and executed for his crimes against the people. #gold The Committee of Union & Progress#! remains resolute in their plans to send the Sultan into exile. #green The Society of Islamic Unity#! intend to maintain the Sultan's position as a figurehead of a new national order. More extreme elements of each faction, however, are planning their own options. Given enough time and resources, these could radically change the outcome of the Sultan's place in this new society."
 dead_man_pulse.9.a: "The #red Worker's Society#! will persuade the people to follow Justice."
 dead_man_pulse.9.b: "The #gold Committee#! shall compromise with both sides to ensure exile."

 dead_man_pulse.9.h: "The people will decide his fate in a #gold referendum#!."
 dead_man_pulse.9.i: "The #green Fundamentalists#! in our institutions will initiate a purge to preserve our society."

 dead_man_pulse.10.t: "Socialist Prisoner Writes Manifesto"
 dead_man_pulse.10.d: "The Sultan once imprisoned socialists to prevent their dangerous ideas from breaking the country. Now, one of them has somehow written and released a Communist Manifesto from the Hapishane-i Umumi itself. Every letter threatens the Empire."
 dead_man_pulse.10.f: "The Beyliks and the Capitalists alike find themselves caught in a crossfire of Socialist ideas spreading rapidly throughout the nation. The perception of this persecuted free-thinker and his words of incitement have caused many common citizens of the nation to unite against his oppression. What can be done to rectify this situation?"
 dead_man_pulse.10.a: "The #red Ottoman Worker's Society#! will negotiate his release to ease tensions."
 dead_man_pulse.10.b: "We must direct #gold the people's#! ire towards conservatism!"
 dead_man_pulse.10.c: "We will weather the storm, and #green endure through faith#!."
 dead_man_pulse.10.e: "Launch a censorship campaign across the nation! Stamp out the flames of Revolution!"

 dead_man_pulse.11.t: "Foreign Republicans Offer Support"
 dead_man_pulse.11.d: "Western Republicanism has always been a threat to the Empire, but with our decline many seek to exploit the opportunity by courting the upper strata of society with promises of grandeur under a liberal regime. Now, foreigners even move into our lands to support this movement."
 dead_man_pulse.11.f: "#gold The Committee of Union & Progress#! has a unique opportunity for garnering increased support to bolster the Republican movement. Foreign Capital has always been kingmaker in the Ottoman Empire of the 19th century. Now, these foreigners wish to instill liberal values throughout the remnants of the Empire and bring a Springtime to the Middle East!"
 dead_man_pulse.11.a: "We need to remind the people of the #red dangers of the Bourgeoisie!#!"
 dead_man_pulse.11.b: "#gold The CUP#! will cooperate with the foreigners to usher in a new Republic!"

 dead_man_pulse.11.e: "Restrict all travel & trade with nations that send these agitators!"

 dead_man_pulse.12.t: "Imams Support Islamic Unity Across Nation"
 dead_man_pulse.12.d: "Whether out of fear of the changing headwinds, loyalty to tradition, or faith in Allah, the Imams of both the Sunni & Shia Ulemma across the country have spoken out in support of the #green Society for Islamic Unity#!. This powerful display of support from the most rural village to the head of the Hagia Sophia has rallied the more religious and conservative-minded peasantry and farmers towards the Fundamentalist cause."
 dead_man_pulse.12.f: "The outspoken support for the #green Ulemma's cause#! has put pressure on the other factions in the state to accede significant ground in garnering their own support from rural communities. The Ulemma have further pressed the advantage with rallying extremists to suppress dissidents and strongarm Beyliks to support their cause. Some have even begun to protest the idea of secularization in any form."
 dead_man_pulse.12.a: "We must unite the #red worker and the farmer#! equally against this extremism!"
 dead_man_pulse.12.b: "We will attempt to rally our strength in the cities to forge our #gold Republic#!."
 dead_man_pulse.12.c: "We thank the Imams and the rural communities for their devotion, #green Allahu Akbar!#!"
 dead_man_pulse.12.e: "With our government independent of the Ulemma, we can mitigate the long-term impact of this movement."
