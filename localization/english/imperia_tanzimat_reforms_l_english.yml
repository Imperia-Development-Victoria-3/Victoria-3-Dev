 #Completion

 sick_man.4.t: "Tanzimat: Liberalism or Absolutism?"
 sick_man.4.d: "With the initial reforms of Mahmud II completed, taking important and necessary steps to reform the Empire into a new age, a heavy debate has broken out between the largest political blocs of the nation. The $ig_variant_devout$ and $ig_variant_armed_forces$ argue that a return to an absolutist form of Pan-Islamism will ensure a return to a stronger, centralized Ottoman State. They cite the renewed colonization efforts by Europeans and their continued industrialization as the greatest cause of concern for the country's survival.\nThe $ig_variant_industrialists$ and $ig_variant_intelligentsia$, in contrast, believe that the time is now for a constitution to be written and for a new era of the Empire to be ushered in. The Sultan, in conjunction with the will of his citizens, shall be the leaders of this brave new world."
 sick_man.4.f: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has completed the initial stages of the Tanzimat reforms. But now a decision must be made."
 sick_man.4.a: "Our future lies in the principles of Ottomanism and liberal ideas!"
 sick_man.4.b: "Our future shall be guided only by the Sultan and Allah!"

 sick_man.2.t: "Tanzimat: The Reorganization"
 sick_man.2.desc: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has successfully modernized and re-asserted itself on the world stage. A new era begins for the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] state.\nThe halting decline of our Empire has shown that we can no longer stand alone to break the darkness which threatens us all. We as Turks, Greeks, Syrians, Kurds, and many others cannot halt the threat of foreign aggression alone.But we can as Ottomans. We, as Muslims, Christians, and Jews, cannot make amends if we stand in opposition to each other. But our faith in this empire can be shared together. We allowed corruption to run too deep into our great Ottoman Empire. But no longer! Now, together, we are on a path to bring the nation to its greatest heights! Let the world see the Ottoman Empire not as the Sick Man of Europe, but as the Beacon of Liberty in the East!"
 sick_man.2.f: ""
 sick_man.2.a: "Our future lies in the heart of Western Republicanism!"
 sick_man.2.b: "All shall hail the Great Reformer!"
 sick_man.2.c: "Let all lost souls rest their weary hearts in our lands!"
 sick_man.2.d: "We are the trees of our forefathers! Let us look to our roots for inspiration!"

 sick_man.5.t: "Tanzimat: The Centralization"
 sick_man.5.desc: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has successfully modernized and re-asserted itself on the world stage. A new era begins for the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] state.\n\nWe are now the masters of our own fate. No longer shall the children of Islam bow to any mortal, but only to Allah. The Sultan, Caliph of Islam and Allah's will made manifest, has the promise of ushering us into a new age of prosperity and strength for the Empire. The snakes around us, who thought us a weak plaything for their games, now look upon us in awe as we do what no other country in history has done and pull back from the brink of self-destruction. The liberals, who sought to weaken our government's absolute authority, have now been stamped out. Now none shall stand in the Sultan's way!"
 sick_man.5.f: ""
 sick_man.5.d: "Let us usher in a Reactionary Renaissance across the Empire!"
 sick_man.5.a: "We must strengthen Sharia Law and unite Islam!"
 sick_man.5.b: "It is time to restore the Empire to its former glory!"
 sick_man.5.c: "Let us settle our old grievances and grant the Sultan absolute authority!"

french_pretenders.3.d: "The efforts to promote the House of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('french_dynasty')] as the sole legitimate dynasty of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetName] are being obstructed by the prominent [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('oppoisition_french_monarchist_ig_scope').GetLeader.GetIdeology.GetName] [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('oppoisition_french_monarchist_ig_scope').GetLeader.GetFullName], who claims [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] is nothing but an upjumped bandit."
french_pretenders.3.f: ""A orderly nation must be built upon solid foundations. There is #italic nothing #! about that house which is 'solid'. Look at them... wrong-headed fools and opportunists, the lot of them!""
french_pretenders.3.a: "Authorize some counter-propaganda."
french_pretenders.3.b: "The "communists" squandered their mandate in 1830."
french_pretenders.3.c: "And some beret-wearing Spanish shepherd is supposed to have a better claim?"
french_pretenders.3.h: "Upjumped bandits? Have those amnesiacs forgotten the July Revolution?"
french_pretenders.3.e: "Is the spawn of the Corsican Ogre meant to be more legitimate?"
french_pretenders.3.g: "Lèse-majesté, you say? Well gag [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('oppoisition_french_monarchist_ig_scope').GetLeader.GetHerHim] then!"
french_pretenders.3.tt: "[SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('oppoisition_french_monarchist_ig_scope').GetLeader.GetFullName] has the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('oppoisition_french_monarchist_ig_scope').GetLeader.GetIdeology.GetName] [concept_ideology]"
 french_pretenders.4.t: "The Real Country"
 french_pretenders.4.d: "Opposed to what they see as the artificially imposed political ideals of the Revolution, members of the country's traditional classes are coming out in support of the [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('dynamic_french_pretender')] cause."
 french_pretenders.4.f: ""Have you been to the city recently? It's obscene how they carry on there. It's like order has been put on its head, with some of the things people do there. Out here, at least, everybody still knows how they're supposed to carry on and what they are.""
 french_pretenders.4.a: "A toast to the hardworking tiller and his family!"
 french_pretenders.4.b: "God bless the parish priest and the flock he leads."
 french_pretenders.4.c: "Together, we shall safeguard [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFormatting] from Godless radicals."
  french_pretenders.6.t: "The Provisional Government"
  french_pretenders.6.d: "The crisis throughout [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has proven too much for [SCOPE.sCharacter('old_ruler_scope').GetFullName] to handle. [SCOPE.sCharacter('monarch_scope').GetSheHe|U] has been forced to abdicate and flee the country, and a provisional republican government has been declared."
  french_pretenders.6.f: ""From that day, a thousand strange systems issued impetuously from the minds of the innovators, and spread through the troubled minds of the crowd. Everything was still standing except royalty and parliament, and it seemed that from the shock of the revolution, society itself had been reduced to dust, and that the new form that should be given to society had been put to competition."" #- Alexis de Tocqueville
  french_pretenders.6.a: "Long live the Republic!"
 french_pretenders.7.t: "The New Monarchy"
 french_pretenders.7.d: "With the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] monarchy restored anew, and a regent temporarily occupying the throne, the time has come to determine which dynasty will be entrusted with the restored crown of France."
 french_pretenders.7.f: "The bells toll at Rheims, but no king sits upon the throne. The three great houses stood apart from each other, its pretenders unwilling to seize the throne. Should one move too quickly, it will face a war on two fronts. France itself seemed in no hurry for the 'right' king to take the throne, only that a king sat upon it."
 french_pretenders.7.a: "The house of Bonaparte will lead us to glory."
 french_pretenders.7.b: "The house of Orleans will grant France prosperity."
 french_pretenders.7.c: "The house of Bourbon will avenge the crimes of the Revolution."

french_pretenders.10.f_1: ""Concitoyens! In the presence of God, I swear to observe faithfully the duties expected of me by the realm; to govern only by the laws and according to the laws; to render fair and equal justice to every one according to his right, and to act in every thing in no other view but that of the interest, the happiness, and the glory of the French people.""
french_pretenders.10.d_2: "In a four-day spectacle of tradition and opulence not seen since the golden age of the Ancien Régime, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] is annointed and crowned [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] in the cathedral of Reims."
french_pretenders.10.f_2: ""Divine Providence, in recalling us to this sanctified place, has laid upon us great obligations. As King of France, we pledge ourselves to be faithful to the charter of the land, reserving to ourselves to maintain it with a new solemnity, before the altars of Him who weighs in the same balance kings and nations.""
french_pretenders.10.d_3: "Donning the robes and regalia of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] antecedent, Napoleon the Great, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] crowns [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerselfHimself] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] in a grand ceremony in the Notre-Dame Cathedral."
french_pretenders.10.f_3: ""In consulation with France, I gracefully accept the honors bestowed upon me by a grateful nation. I swear to the people that this Empire shall be one of peace. There shall be conquests, yes—but they shall be conquests of conciliation, religion and morality! This is our Empire, if there is an Empire to be.""

  french_pretenders_pulse.1.f: ""Friends! We must dream of a better tomorrow for all of France. What is the current regime but a cruel mockery of France's history, all it has ever fought for and all it has ever achieved? To rejuvenate the nation, to move forward, we must forge a new society, picking the very best elements of our history and our traditions to create an order which shall withstand the onslaught of modernity!""

  french_pretenders_pulse.2.d: "Monarchists among the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('royalist_hardliners').GetName] are refusing to swear a loyalty oath to the current government. While ideologically pure, this may undermine their efforts to build political capital in the nation."
  french_pretenders_pulse.2.f: ""How can I swear an allegiance to some pretender regime? To do so would be a betrayal of the crown, and grant this twisted caricature of France a recognition of legitimacy that it does not deserve. No, I say! I shall never serve this bastard regime.""
  french_pretenders_pulse.2.a: "[SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('royalist_hardliners').GetName] show an admirable commitment to their ideals."

Some partisans have gone further with that realization, and are supporting each other in courtroom cases, publishing tracts, and other opposition activities."
  french_pretenders_pulse.3.f: ""The enemy of my enemy is my friend, is he not? Of course, all those bums over there came to the wrong conclusions about what is to be done, but we can burn that bridge when we get to it.""
  french_pretenders_pulse.3.a: "Destroying the establishment requires solidarity among all sorts."
  french_pretenders_pulse.3.b: "It is better to be alone and correct than compromised with bad company."
  french_pretenders_pulse.3.c: "Such unnatural collaboration cannot possibly maintain itself."
  french_pretenders_pulse.4.t: "Republican Apostasy"
  french_pretenders_pulse.4.d: "The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('monarchist_french_ig').GetName] and [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('republican_french_ig').GetName] developed a surprisingly close relationship during their mutual time in opposition. Following the [SCOPE.sCharacter('monarchist_french_ig_leader').GetIdeology.GetNameNoFormatting] Restoration, [SCOPE.sCharacter('republican_french_ig_leader').GetFullName] has announced [SCOPE.sCharacter('republican_french_ig_leader').GetHerHis] conversion to the monarchist cause of [SCOPE.sCharacter('republican_french_ig_leader').GetHerHis] old allies."
