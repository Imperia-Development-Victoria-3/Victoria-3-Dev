 #Completion

 sick_man.4.t: "Tanzimat: Liberalism or Absolutism?"
 sick_man.4.d: "With the initial reforms of Mahmud II completed, taking important and necessary steps to reform the Empire into a new age, a heavy debate has broken out between the largest political blocs of the nation. The $ig_variant_devout$ and $ig_variant_armed_forces$ argue that a return to an absolutist form of Pan-Islamism will ensure a return to a stronger, centralized Ottoman State. They cite the renewed colonization efforts by Europeans and their continued industrialization as the greatest cause of concern for the country's survival.\nThe $ig_variant_industrialists$ and $ig_variant_intelligentsia$, in contrast, believe that the time is now for a constitution to be written and for a new era of the Empire to be ushered in. The Sultan, in conjunction with the will of his citizens, shall be the leaders of this brave new world."
 sick_man.4.f: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has completed the initial stages of the Tanzimat reforms. But now a decision must be made."
 sick_man.4.a: "Our future lies in the principles of Ottomanism and liberal ideas!"
 sick_man.4.b: "Our future shall be guided only by the Sultan and Allah!"

 sick_man.2.t: "Tanzimat: The Reorganization"
 sick_man.2.desc: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has successfully modernized and re-asserted itself on the world stage. A new era begins for the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] state.\nThe halting decline of our Empire has shown that we can no longer stand alone to break the darkness which threatens us all. We as Turks, Greeks, Syrians, Kurds, and many others cannot halt the threat of foreign aggression alone.But we can as Ottomans. We, as Muslims, Christians, and Jews, cannot make amends if we stand in opposition to each other. But our faith in this empire can be shared together. We allowed corruption to run too deep into our great Ottoman Empire. But no longer! Now, together, we are on a path to bring the nation to its greatest heights! Let the world see the Ottoman Empire not as the Sick Man of Europe, but as the Beacon of Liberty in the East!"
 sick_man.2.f: ""
 sick_man.2.a: "Our future lies in the heart of Western Republicanism!"
 sick_man.2.b: "All shall hail the Great Reformer!"
 sick_man.2.c: "Let all lost souls rest their weary hearts in our lands!"
 sick_man.2.d: "We are the trees of our forefathers! Let us look to our roots for inspiration!"

 sick_man.5.t: "Tanzimat: The Centralization"
 sick_man.5.desc: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has successfully modernized and re-asserted itself on the world stage. A new era begins for the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] state.\n\nWe are now the masters of our own fate. No longer shall the children of Islam bow to any mortal, but only to Allah. The Sultan, Caliph of Islam and Allah's will made manifest, has the promise of ushering us into a new age of prosperity and strength for the Empire. The snakes around us, who thought us a weak plaything for their games, now look upon us in awe as we do what no other country in history has done and pull back from the brink of self-destruction. The liberals, who sought to weaken our government's absolute authority, have now been stamped out. Now none shall stand in the Sultan's way!"
 sick_man.5.f: ""
 sick_man.5.d: "Let us usher in a Reactionary Renaissance across the Empire!"
 sick_man.5.a: "We must strengthen Sharia Law and unite Islam!"
 sick_man.5.b: "It is time to restore the Empire to its former glory!"
 sick_man.5.c: "Let us settle our old grievances and grant the Sultan absolute authority!"
