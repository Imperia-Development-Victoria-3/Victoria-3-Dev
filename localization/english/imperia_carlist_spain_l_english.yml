 #Journal Entry
 je_carlist_war: "The Carlist War"
 je_carlist_war_reason: "Encouraged by liberal elements near the end of his reign, Ferdinand VII of Spain issued the pragmatic sanction, allowing his daughter Isabella to become Queen of Spain. This has overriden the god-given rights of his brother Carlos to the succession of the throne, and ensured that there would be no check to the destructive liberal reforms now taking place. With the support of fellow conservatives, as well as the patriotic aid of the Basque and Catalan Fueros, we now stand ready to defeat the pretender Madrid and put our glorious country back on the right path!"

 je_carlist_war_cristinos: "The Carlist War"
 je_carlist_war_cristinos_reason: "Ever-hungry for power, Don Carlos de Borbón has risen in rebellion against the infant Queen Isabella II of Spain and the Queen-Regent Maria Cristina. Harnessing discontent amongst the Basques and Catalans which have simmered since the abolition of their Fuero privileges decades prior. Together, the Carlists, Basques and Catalans have joined together into a force of reaction that seeks to undo all progress made during the reign of King Ferdinand VII. To ensure the survival of liberal reform in Spain, this rebellion must be put down."
