 #Pacification of the Kurdish Tribes
 kurd_pacification: "The Question of Kurdistan"
 kurd_pacification_goal: "Either side must reach 10 points to succeed."
 kurd_pacification_reason: "The Kurdish Emirates are a disparate group of Emirs, each with their individual domains within the region. Often mired in competition with each other, the Ottoman Empire has long used this territory as a proxy fight against the Shia Dynasties in Iran. And although most Kurds have been wrapped under the cloth of the Ottoman Sultan for centuries, there remains hundreds of thousands of Kurds in Iran as well. But during this time, at least, autonomy was granted to the Kurds to maintain their domains. \n This is no longer the case. Now, the Ottoman Empire, in its decline, has as of two years ago declared an end to Kurdish Autonomy. Mir Mohammed of Rawanduz and other Emirs have since attempted to fight this effort by the Ottomans to reign in our collective of nations, but have so far been unsuccessful. \n In contrast, the Ottoman Governor Resid Mehmed Pasha and his cohorts have struggled to maintain a firm grasp on the region, thus plunging it into a state of turmoil as both sides compete for power. The Ottomans hope that through integration of the Kurds into the Empire itself, the unrest can turn into prosperity for both parties. The Emirs, in turn, hope to maintain their freedom and independence, willing to fight for full autonomy and freedom from the Empire if necessary. \n As the nation moves towards either end of the scale, increasing modifiers reflect the progress towards a potential new stage for the Kurdish people. This progress can be influenced by events from both the Kurdish Emirates as well as external nations, primarily the Ottoman Empire itself. Only through completing this entry can the Kurds move on to remove some of the other issues ailing their country, but balancing speed with the potential benefits of pursuing both sides can prove to be its own lucrative asset."

 kurd_pacification.0.t: "Agitation against the Ottomans"
 kurd_pacification.0.d: "The proposed 'Tanzimats' are a threat to the identity and power of both the Kurdish people and the Emirs that control them. We can pursue several methods to help interfere in the Ottoman attempts to control our homelands."
 kurd_pacification.0.f: "The Emirs entreat with each other for how to best handle the matter of the Ottomans. Arguments, bickering, and several bouts break out before they settle down enough for a discussion to be had. The three proposals before the Emirs are as follows: \n The Emirs can help foment unrest and rebellion within the Empire, stirring the Kurds into outrage against their suzerain; The Emirs can help sabotage neighboring Ottoman-controlled states in order to interfere with their supply lines and show our strength; or we may more straightforwardly raid the Ottomans and plunder their caravans in order to build up our own war chest."
 kurd_pacification.0.a: "The stirring of the Kurdish populace will help make a powerful ally in the times to come, and hinder the Ottomans in the meantime."
 kurd_pacification.0.b: "Sabotage and subterfuge will show our power to the Kurdish people."

 kurd_pacification.1.b: "Sabotage and subterfuge will show our power to the Kurdish people."
 kurd_pacification.1.c: "Rally the warriors, we will initiate a raid!"

 kurd_pacification.2.t: "Consolidating the Tribes"
 kurd_pacification.2.d: "While the conflict between the governor and the emirs rages on, there presents opportunities within the Emirates to centralize power and strengthen the Kurdish people in the region regardless of outcome."
 kurd_pacification.2.f: "The consolidation of power into one greater tribe has been a dream long unfulfilled for the Kurds since their nation was divided between the Ottomans and Iranians. But steps can be made to create such a stronger entity, by the pen or the sword. We may also help build up the mountain and desert roads, strengthening the grip of the Emirates for whomever may hold it in the future."
 kurd_pacification.2.a: "We will entreat with a tribe to seek a peaceful unification."
 kurd_pacification.2.b: "We will attempt to dominate a tribe and bring the region under one iron fist."
 kurd_pacification.2.c: "We shall develop the infrastructure of the Emirates to connect all of its people."

 kurd_pacification.2.c: "We shall develop the infrastructure of the Emirates to connect all of its people."

 kurd_pacification.3.t: "Request Ottoman Aid"
 kurd_pacification.3.d: "Every request made will ensure the Ottomans keep a tighter grip on the Emirates, but could provide great boons to our nation."
 kurd_pacification.3.f: "Ottoman aid can come in many enticing forms, bolstering the economic growth and power of the region. Assuming, of course, that they deem us worthy of receiving the resources. The Ottomans can help incentivize private investors to bolster our country's economy or means of warfare, assist us in projecting our power against the Iranians to our east, or offer us support in centralizing the tribes under one unified entity."
 kurd_pacification.3.a: "We will ask for Ottoman investments to strengthen our people."
 kurd_pacification.3.b: "A raid against the Iranians sounds appealing in times such as these."
 kurd_pacification.3.c: "Independence will not matter if we devolve into infighting. We must unite as one."

 otto_kurd.1.t: "A Frayed Frontier"
 otto_kurd.1.desc: "The Kurdish Emirates have engaged in underhanded tactics to weaken our Eastern frontier, threatening our ability to control the Caucasus. The Sultan has been pressed by his administration to respond with strength."
 otto_kurd.1.f: "If the Emirs will not back down quietly, it necessitates that the Empire must pressure them under our boots to make them compliant. The Sultan's advisors and generals have drafted up a suite of responses to this latest incitement. Decimating a Kurdish tribe will surely incite them further, but put them in a much weaker position and stabilize the region for us to focus on other matters. The liberals believe we could also engage in a propaganda campaign to strengthen our popular support in the region. Others believe that funding and sending out our police forces to the fringes to enforce the law will help break the dissent over time, while more radical elements of our government believe that we can methodically root out the dissent piece by piece."
 otto_kurd.1.a: "An eye for an eye. We will ahnihilate one of the tribes entirely."
 otto_kurd.1.b: "We shall teach these Kurds the merits of Ottomanism, even if it comes at the cost of our own resources."
 otto_kurd.1.c: "Crack down on the insurgents with a bolstered police force and break their spirit."
 otto_kurd.1.d: "We will use our esoteric connections we've gained to crush the dissidents quietly."

 otto_kurd.2.t: "Kurdish Raids Threaten our Provinces"
 otto_kurd.2.desc: "Following some early warnings signals of an impending raid, our officers in the East are looking toward the Sultan for a response."
 otto_kurd.2.f: "A frequent, if frustrating occurence, the Kurdish Emirs have launched a new set of raids against our provinces in an attempt to the wealth of Eastern Anatolia for themselves. Plans are already drafted up by our generals on how to handle the situation with a risk of inflaming tensions with the Kurdish population. Without proper organized defences though, our chances are looking sparse."
 otto_kurd.2.a: "Rally the militias available to us, we will attempt to hold them at each town."
 otto_kurd.2.b: "Send in all of the available forces the Governor has to stomp out this threat."
 otto_kurd.2.c: "We will tighten our belts and weather the storm, leaving the provinces to themselves."
 otto_kurd.2.d: "Muster the #color:{0.9,0.9,0} Local Garrisons#! we've built, they will respond rapidly to the problem."
 otto_kurd.2.e: "Deploy the #color:{0.9,0.9,0} National Guard#! to crush this raid forthwith."
 otto_kurd.2.g: "Our #color:{0.9,0.9,0} Emergency Relief Services#! will help mitigate the damage we are likely to face."

 otto_kurd.3.t: "Kurdish Tribes Request Ottoman Investments"
 otto_kurd.3.desc: "Despite our tensions, the Kurdish Emirates seek our economic support in building up the region, supported by the Governor to centralize control."
 otto_kurd.3.f: "'If we build our cities, they will come in droves' Is the running sentiment coming from the Governor's administration at this time, believing that investment into strengthening the region's economy in key urban centers will enable us to make the tribes loyal to us and us alone. The question is what, if anything, we wish to contribute to this culture of warriors and nomads to strengthen our ties."
 otto_kurd.3.a: "We will incentivize private investment into the region."
 otto_kurd.3.b: "We will invest into the local construction industries, diverting funding from our own."
 otto_kurd.3.c: "We can bolster thier military with modern arms and supplies."
 otto_kurd.3.d: "Why bother? We have more important matters to address."

 otto_kurd.4.t: "Kurds prepare Iranian Raid"
 otto_kurd.4.desc: "The Kurdish Emirs have begun mustering their nomadic tribes to launch a raid against Iran. We have a clear opportunity to disrupt our eastern rival, if we are willing to enable it. Alternatively, we could take a stand against it to improve our relations."
 otto_kurd.4.f: "The Iranians have long been a thorn in our side, and a threat to our Eastern Frontier. We have much cause to continue engaging in a contest of strength with them, but it cannot come without a cost. Too much and we risk spilling over into all-out war and threatening our other goals. Too little, and they might perceive it as weakness to be exploited. If we provide direct military support, we will deepend our ties with the Kurds and even possibly make a profit. If we provide funding, we can help them succeed in some moderate harassment. If we denounce them, we'll disincentivize the more loyal Emirs and populace to action, although the Iranians are unlikely to be all that grateful. Or we might simply reject this request, and let the Kurds do as they may."
 otto_kurd.4.a: "Provide direct military aid and make the Iranians bleed."
 otto_kurd.4.b: "Offer them funding, nothing more."
 otto_kurd.4.c: "Denounce the raids for inciting tensions."
 otto_kurd.4.d: "Reject the request and move on."
 otto_kurd.4.e: "Divert some of our home defences to the raid."
 otto_kurd.4.g: "Publicly detach from the raid, but exploit the advantage."
