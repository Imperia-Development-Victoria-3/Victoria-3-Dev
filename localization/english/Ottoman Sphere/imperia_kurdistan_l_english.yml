 #Pacification of the Kurdish Tribes
 kurd_pacification: "The Question of Kurdistan"
 kurd_pacification_goal: "Either side must reach 10 points to succeed."
 kurd_pacification_reason: "The Kurdish Emirates are a disparate group of Emirs, each with their individual domains within the region. Often mired in competition with each other, the Ottoman Empire has long used this territory as a proxy fight against the Shia Dynasties in Iran. And although most Kurds have been wrapped under the cloth of the Ottoman Sultan for centuries, there remains hundreds of thousands of Kurds in Iran as well. But during this time, at least, autonomy was granted to the Kurds to maintain their domains. \n This is no longer the case. Now, the Ottoman Empire, in its decline, has as of two years ago declared an end to Kurdish Autonomy. Mir Mohammed of Rawanduz and other Emirs have since attempted to fight this effort by the Ottomans to reign in our collective of nations, but have so far been unsuccessful. \n In contrast, the Ottoman Governor Resid Mehmed Pasha and his cohorts have struggled to maintain a firm grasp on the region, thus plunging it into a state of turmoil as both sides compete for power. The Ottomans hope that through integration of the Kurds into the Empire itself, the unrest can turn into prosperity for both parties. The Emirs, in turn, hope to maintain their freedom and independence, willing to fight for full autonomy and freedom from the Empire if necessary. \n As the nation moves towards either end of the scale, increasing modifiers reflect the progress towards a potential new stage for the Kurdish people. This progress can be influenced by events from both the Kurdish Emirates as well as external nations, primarily the Ottoman Empire itself. Only through completing this entry can the Kurds move on to remove some of the other issues ailing their country, but balancing speed with the potential benefits of pursuing both sides can prove to be its own lucrative asset."

 kurdistan_tanzimat.1.t: "Agitation against the Ottomans"
 kurdistan_tanzimat.1.d: "The proposed 'Tanzimats' are a threat to the identity and power of both the Kurdish people and the Emirs that control them. We can pursue several methods to help interfere in the Ottoman attempts to control our homelands."
 kurdistan_tanzimat.1.f: "The Emirs entreat with each other for how to best handle the matter of the Ottomans. Arguments, bickering, and several bouts break out before they settle down enough for a discussion to be had. The three proposals before the Emirs are as follows: \n The Emirs can help foment unrest and rebellion within the Empire, stirring the Kurds into outrage against their suzerain; The Emirs can help sabotage neighboring Ottoman-controlled states in order to interfere with their supply lines and show our strength; or we may more straightforwardly raid the Ottomans and plunder their caravans in order to build up our own war chest."
 kurdistan_tanzimat.1.a: "The stirring of the Kurdish populace will help make a powerful ally in the times to come, and hinder the Ottomans in the meantime."
 kurdistan_tanzimat.1.b: "Sabotage and subterfuge will show our power to the Kurdish people."
 kurdistan_tanzimat.1.c: "Rally the warriors, we will initiate a raid!"

 kurdistan_tanzimat.2.t: "Consolidating the Tribes"
 kurdistan_tanzimat.2.d: "While the conflict between the governor and the emirs rages on, there presents opportunities within the Emirates to centralize power and strengthen the Kurdish people in the region regardless of outcome."
 kurdistan_tanzimat.2.f: "The consolidation of power into one greater tribe has been a dream long unfulfilled for the Kurds since their nation was divided between the Ottomans and Iranians. But steps can be made to create such a stronger entity, by the pen or the sword. We may also help build up the mountain and desert roads, strengthening the grip of the Emirates for whomever may hold it in the future."
 kurdistan_tanzimat.2.a: "We will entreat with a tribe to seek a peaceful unification."
 kurdistan_tanzimat.2.b: "We will attempt to dominate a tribe and bring the region under one iron fist."
 kurdistan_tanzimat.2.c: "We shall develop the infrastructure of the Emirates to connect all of its people."

 kurdistan_tanzimat.3.t: "Request Ottoman Aid"
 kurdistan_tanzimat.3.d: "Every request made will ensure the Ottomans keep a tighter grip on the Emirates, but could provide great boons to our nation."
 kurdistan_tanzimat.3.f: "Ottoman aid can come in many enticing forms, bolstering the economic growth and power of the region. Assuming, of course, that they deem us worthy of receiving the resources. The Ottomans can help incentivize private investors to bolster our country's economy or means of warfare; The Ottomans can assist us in projecting our power against the Iranians to our east "
