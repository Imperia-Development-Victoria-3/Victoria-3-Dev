Convinced that the day was not lost, the general and their men led a counterattack back into the capital and rallied the last remaining defenders against the traitors seeking violent change.\nFighting lasted until the following morning, which was particularly brutal as the military had far less shyness from violence than the police and guard who had done the early fighting. As the dust settled, the coup was clearly a failure as its leaders fled into the countryside to hiding places or foreign lands.\nWe have won!"

By the end of it [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] and those loyal to them were left dead on the street."

The audacity!\nWorse yet, it seems that so-called freethinkers band together with the sole purpose of scrutinizing our government. We must be careful with our dealings both internal and external, or else face those stuck-up opportunists.\nThey may appear harmless at first, but given ample time and opportunities, they could tear us apart via [concept_political_discord]."

England and America, on the bank, shout at me on no account to clutch the Russian straw. But do they help me? No.\nThey jeer themselves and at the same time tell me not to clutch that Russian straw. I know it is a straw, but better that than nothing.'\n\nSun Yat-sen on the Republic and Soviet Russia, 1923"
