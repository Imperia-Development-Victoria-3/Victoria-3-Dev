 #Journal Entries
 
 je_end_han_discrimination:0 "End the Han Discrimination"
 je_end_han_discrimination_reason:0 "To ensure the submission of the Han people towards their new Manchu rulers, the founder of the Qing Dynasty, Emperor Hong Taiji decreed that the traditional Han hairstyle would be abandoned in favour of wearing the Manchu queue for all male subjects. Other discriminatory measures emerged over the centuries of Qing rule, including the steady expulsion of Han bannermen from the Eight Banners into the less prestigious Green Standard Army, as well as a de-facto ban on high-level positions within the Imperial government. All of these measures have culminated in a constant lingering hatred of the Qing Dynasty and its Manchu elite, ready to boil over into open rebellion should we show weakness."
 
 je_qing_administrative_reform:0 "Administrative Reform"
 je_qing_administrative_reform_reason:0 "In an attempt to concentrate power in the Imperial Court and Emperor, the routine administration of China was stifled in favour of having all matters of import be decided in the "Inner Court" dominated by the Imperial family and Manchu nobility. Whilst a suitable system during the time of the Qianlong and Kangxi Emperors, this concentration of power now hinders our policies in the outlying regions and limits the collection of proper information; with the last census being conducted in 1713. The prevailing system greatly hampers our ability to raise revenue and directly address issues faced by the provinces outside of the capital region of Beijing."
 
 je_rural_poverty_qing:0 "Combat Rural Poverty"
 je_rural_poverty_qing_reason:0 "Rapid population growth throughout the centuries, a lack of available land and crushing taxes targeted disproportionately at the peasant population have lead to a widespread deterioration of living standards in rural areas throughout China. If we are to maintain the Mandate of Heaven, the livelihood and welfare of our subjects must be a key priority."
 je_rural_poverty_qing_goal:0 "3 substates have made progress in combating rural poverty."
 
 je_rural_poverty_substate:0 "Combat Rural Poverty"
 je_rural_poverty_substate_reason:0 "Rapid population growth throughout the centuries, a lack of available land and crushing taxes targeted disproportionately at the peasant population have lead to a widespread deterioration of living standards in rural areas throughout China."
 
 je_end_female_infanticide:0 "End Female Infanticide"
 je_end_female_infanticide_reason:0 "In Chinese society, women are treated with little value due to their inability to work the fields as a result of the custom of foot-binding, as well the patriarchal structure of the clan system. Consequently, female infanticide has emerged as local custom in many regions of China, resulting in a glut of unmarried men with little hopes of creating a family."
 
 je_pacify_highland_tribes:0 "Pacify Highland Tribes"
 je_pacify_highland_tribes_reason:0 "Tusi, translated to "headmen" or "chieftains" are hereditary tribal leaders recognized as imperial officials by the Qing Dynasty in the frontier regions of Yunnan and Guizhou. Whilst useful for ensuring the loyalty of the Zhuang and Yi tribes in the region; the autonomy and privileges granted by the Tusi system significantly limit our ability to develop and administrate the provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou."
 
 je_silk_march: "The Weathered March of China"
 je_silk_march_reason: "Gansu has for much of its history been an important March on the edge of China, projecting Chinese power west into the Tarim Basin and Central Asia. Its strategic significance as not only a military waypoint but also a key component of the Silk Road has sustained it for many centuries. However, recent decades have led to its decline. Forts are in disrepair, deserters are increasing, and social unrest from ethnic and religious minorities is on the rise. We must overcome these obstacles to have a refurbished and powerful March of the East."
 je_silk_march_goal: "Have sufficient [concept_tax_capacity] and level 3 in Home Defence with appropriate laws."

 je_gateway_to_the_west:0 "Gateway to the West"
 je_gateway_to_the_west_reason:0 "The port city of Guangzhou has always been an important maritime trade hub since its incorporation into the Han Dynasty in the 3rd century AD. The city was also the staging point for Zheng He's expeditions across the Indian Ocean, and was the first arrival point for travellers from the West such as the likes of Ibn Battuta, Marco Polo and Odoric of Pordenone. Under the Qing, Guangzhou remains the only open port in China, with trade strictly regulated under the Canton System. This has granted Guangdong far greater exposure to the West, which can potentially be leveraged for access to great wealth and knowledge."
 
 je_breadbasket_of_the_south:0 "Breadbasket of the South"
 je_breadbasket_of_the_south_reason:0 "The provinces of Hunan and Jiangxi are located on some of the most agriculturally productive ground in China, with the grain surpluses from Hunan alone often exported to address shortfalls throughout the rest of China. The productivity of the soil and the wealth it has allowed local peasants to obtain has spared Huguang from the rural poverty that plagues the rest of China, but has simultaneously entrenched a conservative and agrarian social order that will undoubtedly hamper modernization."

 je_settle_the_steppe:0 "Settle the Steppe"
 je_settle_the_steppe_reason:0 "The Manchu homeland has always been sparsely populated, even more so after the migration of the Manchu Tribes southwards during the formation of the Qing Dynasty. A series of ditches and embankments known as the 'Willow Palisade' was erected in the early years of the Qing Dynasty to protect Manchuria from Han settlement. However, with the increasing expansion of the Russian Empire towards the frontiers of China, it would be prudent to further encourage the settlement and urbanization of Manchuria to further solidify the Qing Dynasty's claim to the region."
 
 je_pacify_and_settle_taiwan:0 "Bureau for the Pacification and Settlement of Taiwan"
 je_pacify_and_settle_taiwan_reason:0 "Taiwan, known to the West as Formosa, has been part of the Qing Dynasty ever since the defeat of Kingdom of Tungning in 1683. For centuries, settlement of the island has been greatly restricted due to a general disinterest from the Qing in sustaining any sort of extensive military or administrative presence on the island. Despite this, Han settlers continue to arrive on the island's shores every year, and local officials are growing increasingly interested in further settlement and pacification of Taiwan to raise additional revenue for the Qing Dynasty's expenditure."
 je_pacify_and_settle_taiwan_goal:0 "Increase the GDP by 2 million."
 
 je_establish_local_armies:0 "Establish a Local Army"
 je_establish_local_armies_reason:0 "The deterioration of the Banner System has had wide-reaching effects on the ability of the central government in Beijing to properly defend the Middle Kingdom from the encroaching barbarians. One needs look no further than the White Lotus Rebellion a few decades ago to see that the myth of Manchu military supremacy has been shattered. To ensure the ability of our province to defend itself, several local officials have suggested the establishment of 'Brave Battalions' (Yong-Ying) mustered from the local Han population. Whilst the Qing court will not look favourably upon the creation of such a force for fear of weakening Imperial authority, our local armies would be free from much of the corruption and disorganization that has plagued the Eight Banners."
 
 je_industrialize_china:0 "Industrialize China"
 je_industrialize_china_reason:0 "During the preceding Ming and the current Qing Dynasty, the mercantile class was marginalized and seen as unproductive due to the nature of their work being the movement of goods and services rather than the production of them. This has greatly stunted economic growth in China and hamstrung efforts to develop large-scale industry. However, times must now change and we must allow the mercantile class to lead us forward into the future."
 
 je_promote_western_learning:0 "Promote Western Learning"
 je_promote_western_learning_reason:0 "The Imperial Examination system has proven itself to be too rigid and inefficient in an ever-increasingly complicated world. It has been suggested that the addition of western subjects such as Mathematics, Commerce, Science and Engineering in order to ensure that our officials are prepared for this brave new world."

 je_chinese_national_identity:0 "Establish a National Identity"
 je_chinese_national_identity_reason:0 "The territory of China is not a monolith. Millenia of Han expansionism beginning from China's early days as warring kingdoms on the shores of the Yellow River has resulted in a multitude of different dialects and cultures united only by Imperial rule. A cohesive national identity must be created out of the many different Chinese dialects, or the only future that awaits us is one of fragmentation alongside linguistic lines."
 
 je_investigate_military_reform:0 "Investigate Reform of the Banner System"
 je_investigate_military_reform_reason:0 "Whilst an effective fighting force in the early years of the Qing, the traditional martial spirit of the Eight Banners has long since been lost. Their claim to be military men is based on their descent rather than on their skill in arms; and their pay is given them because of their fathers' prowess, and not at all from any hopes of their efficiency as soldiers. A new military system must be established; though we should remain wary of an attempt by the Banners to maintain their positions and privileges."
 
 je_reform_the_banner_system_local:0 "Formalize the Yong-Ying System"
 je_reform_the_banner_system_local_reason:0 "Throughout the provinces, local officials have already begun organizing ad-hoc units and formations to supplement the ineffective Banners stationed within their jurisdiction. Some officials within the government have suggested formalizing these armies and establishing new ones organized around similar lines to defend China from threats both within and without."
 je_reform_the_banner_system_local_goal:0 "Four substates have established local armies."
 
 je_reform_the_banner_system_modern:0 "Create a New Army"
 je_reform_the_banner_system_modern_reason:0 "Whilst provincial officials have begun organizing ad-hoc units and formations to supplement the ineffective Banners stationed within their jurisdiction, such units weaken the central authority of the Emperor and will prove difficult to control. Some officials within the government have suggested that the Banner System be replaced with a new professional army, free of the hereditary conditions that have allowed our military might to stagnate."
 
 je_warlord_china_goal:0 "Fragile Unity has reached 100%"

 imperia_qing.1.t:0 "Imperial Decline"
 imperia_qing.1.d:0 "The end of the Qianlong Emperor's reign in 1796 marked the end of the High Qing period. In the 40 years since his death, the problems that have plagued the Qing Dynasty have only continued to worsen, with some believing that it may lead to its outright collapse."
 imperia_qing.1.f:0 "The problems we face are many; the decline of the Banner System leaves us weak to the threat of barbarian nations that surround us, and problems throughout the provinces have contributed greatly to ever greater disatisfaction and unrest amongst the peasantry. 
 imperia_qing.1.a:0 "Surely all is well under Heaven's Mandate?"
 
 imperia_qing.2.t:0 "Anti-Manchu Sentiment"
 imperia_qing.2.d:0 "Triggered by the perceived oppression and failures of the Manchu-led Qing Dynasty, Han civilians in the provinces have begun to rally under the slogan of 'Fan Qing'; literally meaning 'Oppose the Qing'.
 imperia_qing.2.f:0 "The grievances of the Han are many, chief among them the enforcement of the Manchu queue, the favouritism showed to the soldiers of the Eight Banners and the de-facto exclusion of Han officials from the highest posts of the Imperial government."
 imperia_qing.2.a:0 "Launch a reprisal against these dissidents!"
 imperia_qing.2.b:0 "Ignore them, they pose no threat."
 
 imperia_qing.3.t:0 "The Decline of the Qing"
 imperia_qing.3.d:0 "The end of the Qianlong Emperor's reign in 1796 marked the end of the High Qing period. In the 40 years since his death, the problems that have plagued the Qing Dynasty have only continued to worsen, with some believing that it may lead to its outright collapse."
 imperia_qing.3.f:0 "The problems we face are many; the decline of the Banner System leaves us weak to the threat of barbarian nations that surround us, and problems throughout the provinces have contributed greatly to ever greater disatisfaction and unrest amongst the peasantry. 
 imperia_qing.3.a:0 "Something must be done."
 
 imperia_qing.4.t:0 "The New Army"
 imperia_qing.4.d:0 "The dismantlement of the old Banner System and the creation of a new military force for the defense of the Qing Empire has finally borne fruit."
 imperia_qing.4.f:0 "The parade of the New Army in front of the Tiananmen Gate was a spectacle to behold; their pennants fluttered in the wind and the march of military boots filled the air. Their colourful uniforms and western rifles were a strange sight for many of the people of Beijing, who saw little in resemblance to the warriors of the past. Nevertheless, they too understood that these new soldiers were more fearsome than anything ever seen before."
 imperia_qing.4.a:0 "The New Army will lead us to victory!"
 imperia_qing.4.b:0 "The Beiyang Army will safeguard the Emperor and Northern China!"
 
 imperia_qing.5.t:0 "Tyranny of the Eight Banners"
 imperia_qing.5.d:0 "Angered at the Emperor's attempts to curtail the privileges of the Manchu Bannermen in favour of a new army led by the Han, several units of Bannermen, with the help of sympathetic palace officials have stormed the Forbidden City and deposed the incumbent Emperor, installing a puppet ruler in his place."
 imperia_qing.5.f:0 ""Foreigners appreciate only military power. Thus, they shall submit to us wholeheartedly and do not dare to oppose China once we display our hunting techniques to them."\n-Qianlong Emperor"
 imperia_qing.5.a:0 "Let us never again stray from our martial traditions."
 
 imperia_qing.6.t:0 "Christian Sects"
 imperia_qing.6.d:0 "Ever since our defeat in the Opium War, increasing numbers of Christian missionaries have begun utilizing the treaty ports as a gateway into the interior of China to spread their barbaric faith."
 imperia_qing.6.f:0 "The activities of the missionaries in Nanjing have been particularly prominent, it is estimated that they have accumulated hundreds of thousands of converts in the city alone."
 imperia_qing.6.a:0 "Keep a close watch for further developments."
 
 imperia_qing_substates.1.t:0 "The Viceroyalty of Sichuan"
 imperia_qing_substates.1.d:0 "Comprised of the Governorates of Sichuan and Yun-Gui, the Viceroyalty of Sichuan is divided between the Sinicized Sichuan Basin, once the heartland of the ancient state of Shu Han, and the isolated Yun-Gui Highlands. Whilst the highland tribes swear fealty to the Qing Emperor and have nominally agreed to adopt Chinese customs and open land for Han settlement, progress is slow and the autonomy granted to the tribes under the Tusi system remains a barrier to the development of the southern provinces."
 imperia_qing_substates.1.f:0 "Building upon the Yuan precedent, the Ming began its colonization of the southwest in the 1370s, and though its military strength waxed and waned, it was able to eliminate the largest autonomous kingdoms in the southwest by the early decades of the seventeenth century. Under the Qing, the Yongzheng Emperor's appointment of his trusted Manchu official Ortai and the aggressive campaign against Tusi offices they initiated in the 1720s in the southwest should be seen as the continuation, not the beginning, of China's colonization of the southwest."
 imperia_qing_substates.1.a:0 "We must re-double our efforts!"
 
 imperia_qing_substates.2.t:0 "The Pacification of Yun-Gui"
 imperia_qing_substates.2.d:0 "Through a series of reforms that have gradually stripped power away from the Tusi and towards provincial officials appointed by the Viceroy and Qing Emperor, the officials of Sichuan have managed to establish firm control over the governance of the Yun-Gui highlands."
 imperia_qing_substates.2.f:0 "To maintain control and loyalty amongst the tribes, it has been suggested that a system of divide and rule be put into place, with one of the tribes previously opposed to Qing rule privileged in the administration to sow division between the Zhuang, Miao and Yi."
 imperia_qing_substates.2.a:0 "The Zhuang have proven to be the most cooperative."
 imperia_qing_substates.2.b:0 "Together with the Yi, we shall rule the Highlands."
 imperia_qing_substates.2.c:0 "Like the Han, the Miao are outsiders. We should work with them."
 
 imperia_qing_substates.3.t:0 "Tribal Conflicts Erupt"
 imperia_qing_substates.3.d:0 "Tensions between the highland tribes have reached a tipping point, and a conflict seems inevitable."
 imperia_qing_substates.3.f:0 ""Feuds between the Zhuang, Yi and Miao are nothing new, though a large-scale conflict between them will have severe consequences for trade and development of the Southern Provinces as well as the safety of Han settlers who will be caught in the crossfire.""
 imperia_qing_substates.3.a:0 "Tribal affairs are none of our concern."
 imperia_qing_substates.3.b:0 "Send in the army to enforce order!"
 
 imperia_qing_substates.4.t:0 "Han Colony Raided"
 imperia_qing_substates.4.d:0 "Reports have reached Chengdu that Han settlers in the Yun-Gui Highlands have been attacked by members of the highland tribes."
 imperia_qing_substates.4.f:0 ""They came under the cover of darkness. We were awoken by the smell of acrid smoke and yells of a foreign tongue. Fearful for our lives we barred the doors and windows of our homes and waited for the noise to subside. It was dawn by the time the noise subsided and we felt safe enough to leave. All that awaited us was a scene of devastation; they had taken our livestock and grain and burnt everything else...""
 imperia_qing_substates.4.a:0 "They knew the risks. There is nothing we can do."
 imperia_qing_substates.4.b:0 "Dispatch a punitive expedition!"
 
 imperia_qing_substates.5.t:0 "Highlanders Sinicized!"
 imperia_qing_substates.5.d:0 "Our efforts to assimilate the highland tribes have borne fruit, with many villages adopting Chinese customs and language and welcoming the arrival of Han migrants into their communities."
 imperia_qing_substates.5.f:0 ""The district magistrate of Anshun has reported an uptick in the registration of highlanders within the district records. Fifty-three individuals have adopted the family name 'Wang', twenty-seven have adopted the family name 'Li', and three more the family name 'Liu'.""
 imperia_qing_substates.5.a:0 "All is proceeding according to plan."

 imperia_qing_substates.6.t:0 "Linguistic Conference"
 imperia_qing_substates.6.d:0 "The vast empire of China is sprawling and challenging to maintain. There is little sense of a national identity or even a national language. Regional dialects can be completely unintelligble, hindering the administration."
 imperia_qing_substates.6.f:0 "China is whole under the Qing Emperor, but linguistically it is utterly divided. Until we can establish a single, standard national language, the various bureaucrats and scholars of our realm will struggle to make an impact upon the rural provinces. By convening a council of delegates, we can begin the process of standardising the Chinese language."
 imperia_qing_substates.6.a:0 "Send messengers to the provinces."
 
 imperia_qing_substates.7.t:0 "Linguistic Conference: A Summons"
 imperia_qing_substates.7.d:0 "An emissary has arrived from the Imperial Court. The Emperor has declared that a national convention shall be held to establish a standard form for the Chinese language."
 imperia_qing_substates.7.f:0 "Several of our local intellectuals and scholars believe firmly that the dialect spoken in [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetName] represents the purest form of the Chinese language. We may have the opportunity to model much of the new Mandarin after our local tongue, giving us a distinct advantage over the other regions of China."
 imperia_qing_substates.7.a:0 "We must put forward our dialect as a candidate."
 imperia_qing_substates.7.b:0 "We will attend and have our voice be heard."
 imperia_qing_substates.7.c:0 "We want no part in this."

 imperia_qing_substates.8.t:0 "Linguistic Conference: Assembled"
 imperia_qing_substates.8.d:0 "The Emperor, in his wisdom, has declared that a gathering of notable scholars and representatives shall assemble at the Imperial Court to chart the future of the Chinese language."
 imperia_qing_substates.8.f:0 "There are delegates from #variable [SCOPE.sCountry('qing_language_conference_main_tag').MakeScope.GetVariable('qing_language_conference_voters_count').GetValue|0v]#! territories of the empire. We require a majority of #variable [SCOPE.sCountry('qing_language_conference_main_tag').MakeScope.GetVariable('qing_language_conference_majority').GetValue|0v]#! to successfully select a dialect.\n\n- The #variable Imperial Officials#! favour the #variable Beijing#! variety of Mandarin as the new standardized form of Chinese.\n\n- [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('imperia_linguistics_yue_stance')] \n\n- [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('imperia_linguistics_sichuan_stance')]\n\n- [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('imperia_linguistics_huguang_stance')]\n\n- [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('imperia_linguistics_formosa_stance')]"
 imperia_qing_substates.8.a:0 "May we come to an accord."

 imperia_qing_substates.9.title:0 "Linguistic Conference: The Final Vote"
 imperia_qing_substates.9.desc:0  "After much deliberation and debate, the time has come for the representatives to vote on final proposal."
 imperia_qing_substates.9.flavour:0  ""We must look to the future! The old ways are obsolete. The Latin alphabet of the West will prepare us for this new age!"\n\n"You would discard thousands of years of tradition? Have you no shame?!"\n\n"Gentlemen please, the debate period has ended.""
 imperia_qing_substates.9.a:0 "The Beijing dialect is best suited for the Chinese people."
 imperia_qing_substates.9.b:0 "Sichuan Mandarin is the obvious choice."
 imperia_qing_substates.9.c:0 "The Liangguang dialect will prepare us for the future."
 imperia_qing_substates.9.d:0 "We will adopt Huguang's dialect."
 imperia_qing_substates.9.e:0 "Formosa's dialect is the best candidate."
 imperia_qing_substates.10.t:0 "Linguistic Conference: A Conclusion"

 imperia_qing_substates.10.d:0 "With #variable [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetVariable('qing_language_conference_beijing_votes').GetValue|0v]#! votes for the Beijing dialect, #variable [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetVariable('qing_language_conference_sichuan_votes').GetValue|0v]#! for the Sichuan dialect, #variable [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetVariable('qing_language_conference_liangguang_votes').GetValue|0v]#! for the Liangguang dialect, #variable [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetVariable('qing_language_conference_huguang_votes').GetValue|0v]#! for the Huguang dialect and #variable [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetVariable('qing_language_conference_formosa_votes').GetValue|0v]#! for the Formosa dialect, the [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('imperia_linguistics_conference_winning_dialect_name')] dialect has been chosen by the delegates to form the basis for a new standard form of the Chinese Language."
 imperia_qing_substates.10.f:0 ""A toast to the new China!"\n\n"And a new Chinese language!""
 imperia_qing_substates.10.a:0 "And what a beautiful language indeed."
 imperia_qing_substates.10.b:0 "Now to practice my pronunciation."
 imperia_qing_substates.10.c:0 "We will maintain our identity."

 imperia_qing_substates.11.t:0 "Linguistic Conference: Failure"

Standardization seems unlikely at this time."
 imperia_qing_substates.11.f:0 "The delegates trade a few parting shots as they leave the chamber. Backroom deals, heated negotiations and passionate speeches have come to nothing as the conference draws to a close. The dream of a unified Chinese language seems more distant than ever."
 imperia_qing_substates.11.a:0 "A regrettable outcome."

 imperia_qing_substates.12.t:0 "Chuang Guandong"
 imperia_qing_substates.12.d:0 "As a result of efforts by both the provincial government and local landowners, a new wave of Han settlers has crossed the Willow Palisade into the Manchu homelands."
 imperia_qing_substates.12.f:0 "Near Weiyuanbao Gate there is nothing to see but old tree stumps. The local Bannermen had cut them down for kindling, and the dikes had been filled in after a nobleman nearly broke his neck when his horse fell in. The remaining gates were falling apart, even if the local official still staffed them with tax collectors. The path to Guandong was open."
 imperia_qing_substates.12.a:0 "Welcome!"

 imperia_qing_substates.13.t:0 "The Fate of the Manchus"
 imperia_qing_substates.13.d:0 "Han settlement of the Manchu homelands has changed the very fabric of our society. Where the Manchu people were once separate from the Han, increasing urbanization has led many to adopt Han language and customs. Where we were once the masters of our ancestral home, there is the very possibility that we may find ourselves a minority in our own land in but a few more decades."
 imperia_qing_substates.13.a:0 "While our people may fade, the Empire we built shall endure!"
 imperia_qing_substates.13.b:0 "The Manchu people will never fade away!"

 #Opium Epidemic
 je_the_opium_dilemma:0 "The Opium Dilemma"
 je_the_opium_dilemma_reason:0 "Whilst the central government in Beijing grapples with foreign opium smuggling along the coastal regions of China, a domestic opium smuggling route has come to our attention. Tribes such as the Yi and Miao of Sichuan and the Zhuang of Yunnan province, given autonomy and self-government under the Tusi System, have begun their own cultivation of the drug, which in turn is sold to Han traffickers who peddle the drug to cities within the province and further beyond. Officials are divided on whether or not to crack down on cultivation and smuggling, or make attempts to regulate it and allow for revenue from Opium sales to enrich the provincial treasury. The profits that can be made are vast, to be sure, but is it worth compromising our morality and forsaking our duty as servants of the Qing Emperor?"

 je_chinese_opium_trade:0 "Profits from the Opium Trade"
 je_chinese_opium_trade_reason:0 "Trading in Opium has done much to enrich the local treasury and provide the Viceroy with additional revenue with which to carry out his duties. Nevertheless, we walk under a fine line. If the central government were to find out about our illicit activities, the repercussions will be severe."

 je_opium_trade_participation:0 "Participate in the Opium Trade"
 je_opium_trade_participation_reason:0 "Trading in Opium has the potential to bring much needed revenue to the provincial government in these difficult times that we find ourselves in. The moral consequences are clear, for we will be complicit in poisoning our own people, and there is no doubt we will draw the ire of the central government if our activities are discovered."

 je_the_opium_struggle:0 "The Opium Epidemic"
 je_the_opium_struggle_reason:0 "With our defeat in the Opium War, our chance for a straightforward path to handle the influx of Opium into China has been lost. Our defeat has undoubtedly enboldened domestic actors seeking to profit from the Opium Trade. Whilst we bide our time and recover our strength in preparation for finally settling this issue with the Western barbarians, we should first ensure that domestic opium smuggling has been curtailed before we attempt to challenge the West once more."
 je_the_opium_struggle_goal:0 "The following has been true for 5 years:"

 modifier_opium_profits:0 "Opium Trade Profits"
 modifier_opium_ascendant:0 "Opium Ascendant"
 modifier_opium_eradicated:0 "Opium Eradicated"

 opium_epidemic_explanation:0 "To crack down on Opium production and smuggling in the provinces, we must ensure that our viceroys have no Opium Plantations above size 5. Be aware that viceroyalties engaged in Opium production will contribute greatly to the Imperial Treasury. However, letting this situation persist for too long will damage the authority of the Central Government."

 imperia_china_opium.1.t:0 "A Concerning Missive"
 imperia_china_opium.1.d:0 "We have received anonymous reports from officials throughout the provinces that provincial officials, in violation of Imperial edict and the authority granted to them by the Emperor, have begun to involve themselves in the Opium trade that is poisoning our nation."
 imperia_china_opium.1.a:0 "We must monitor the situation."

 imperia_china_opium.2.t:0 "Opium Eradicated"
