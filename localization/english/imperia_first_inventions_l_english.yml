 first_inventions_events.17.d: "With the constant advances of artillery and firearms, killing has never been this easy, yet the same can be said about getting killed! Our officers are overjoyed with the first part, yet repeatedly call foul on the second part.\n\nAfter extensive deliberations and intense bouts of shouting, our military think tanks have devised a novel approach to battlefield tactics: to create cover where there was none previously, expanding a series of dug-out tunnels across the frontlines! This clever approach would allow our brave troops to mow down enemy units from the relative safety of said trenches.\n\nProvided they don't have trenches of their own and ever-so-kindly charge into our general direction, of course."

 first_inventions_events.18.d: "Our officers are fuming at their mouths, having heard reports of new [SCOPE.sCountry('inventor_scope').GetAdjective] battlefield tactics. Decrying their defensive focus and risk-averse approach as cowardly, asinine and needlessly time-consuming.\n\nReportedly, their troops hunker down in complex tunnel-like mazes dug out at the frontlines, only ever rearing their ugly heads to take safe shots at their enemies, never taking unnecessary risk. They seem staunchly unwilling to charge head-first into battle across an open field, displaying truly unsportsmanlike behavior.\n\nWorse yet, they appear to be winning!"
